# Image-Super-Resolution-using-Interpolation-and-Wavelets
This project enhances low-resolution images by combining interpolation with wavelet-based reconstruction. Interpolation upsamples the image, and wavelet processing restores edges and fine details, producing a clearer, sharper high-resolution output.
